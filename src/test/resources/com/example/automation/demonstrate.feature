Feature: Demonstrate
  As a BDD tester
  I want an automated Android mobile BDD testing framework
  So I can streamline my development process

  Scenario: Welcome Message
    Given I am on the screen with keyword "Send"
#    And I enter text "Hello World!"
#    When I click the "Send" button
#    Then I am taken to the "Display Message" screen
#    And the message "Hello World!" is displayed
